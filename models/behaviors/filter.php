	/**
	 * Adapted from work by Brenton (http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/habtm-searching)
	 * New function to help with searching where conditions involve HABTM.
	 * Nothing too fancy for now, just deals with first level (ex. no `with`), also, not sure how it'll
	 * react for multiple fields.
	 * So pretty much just best for `id` of a foreign key.
	 * For HABTM, association condition should not be on the join table, but association. So if:
	 *    User HABTM Interests, and searching for Users, should be Interest.id.
	 * TODO: End result uses the 'IN' operator for the query, which is equivalent to 'OR', and will 
	 * eventually want 'AND' instead.
	 * TODO: Test in conditions where no 'with'
	 *
	 * @return array Modified queryData array
